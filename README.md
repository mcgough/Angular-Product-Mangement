# [Angular Ecomm Demo](https://angularecommdemo.herokuapp.com/)

[https://angularecommdemo.herokuapp.com/](https://angularecommdemo.herokuapp.com/)

This project is based on the PluralSight Angular path: Angular: Getting Started where the instructor creates a Product management app. I wanted to expand on that idea to solidify what I had learned, so I created a demo front-end experience for an e-comm site. I expand on the tutorial by adding inventory and reviews to the products as well as adding a cart to simulate the shopping experience.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.4 and uses Angular 4 as well as Redux for state management.

<!-- ## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
